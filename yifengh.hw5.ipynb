The sequence consists of non-negative integers and arithmetic operators and ends with an equal sign.__It also contain spaces to improve readability.__ __The operators only contain \"+-*/\"__, and the operator / represents integer division, rounded down. You may assume that no test case contains division by zero and that in all test cases all intermediate results are non-negative. __Hint:__ you may use eval() function. __Note:__ You don't need to worry about error checking for this question, but you are welcome to perform some appropriate error checking."

    "1. You are given a string $s$. Suppose a character '$c$' occurs consecutively $x$ times in the string. __In this problem, we assume each character is in '0123456789', representing a number between 0 and 9.__ Replace these consecutive occurrences of the character '$c$' with $(x,c)$ in the string and store into a list.

For example, the result of `comp_str('1222311')` is `[(1, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1)]`. Reason: First, the character '1' occurs only once, so it is replaced by (1,1).

For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?' - Galadriel to Frodo and Sam, describing her Mirror. We call a string S magical if every substring of S appears in Galadriel's Mirror (under lateral inversion). In other words, a magical string is a string where every substring has its reverse in the string. Write a function __magical__, that takes a string S as its argument, determine if it is magical or not, and return the result: \"Yes\" is it is magical, or \"No\" if it is not magical. For example, magical('aba') is 'Yes'. Reason: the list of substrings are : a, b, ab, ba, aba. The reverse of each of these strings is present as a substring of S too. __Note:__ You don't need to worry about error checking for this question, but you are welcome to perform some appropriate error checking."

    " Your problem with the new policy is that it has become quite tricky to determine when your print job will actually be completed. You decide to write a program to figure this out. The program will be given the current queue (as a list of priorities) as well as the position of your job in the queue, and must then calculate how long it will take until your job is printed, assuming that no additional jobs will be added to the queue. To simplify matters, we assume that printing a job always takes exactly one minute, and that adding and removing jobs from the queue is instantaneous.\n",

This function should return a number , which is the number of minutes until your job is completely printed, assuming that no additional print jobs will arrive."

Help Johnny to figure out whether the given 3-by-3 board can reach the goal state or not. Define a function __solve_puzzle__ that takes an 3-by-3 numpy array (i.e., an ndarray) as its only argument and returns Python Boolean that is True if and only if the given 3-by-3 board can reach the goal state. __Hint:__ You can start from the goal state, walk through all the possible states and save them into a global variable. You function just need to judge if the given state is inside the possible states or not."
