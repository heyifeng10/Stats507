The columns are explained in a __.txt__ file which you can download from https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/glfields.txt, but we will only make use of a few of them in this problem. The 10-th and 11-th columns (using 1-indexing) are the scores of the visiting and home teams, respectively. Rename these columns __v_score__ and __h_score__, respectively. MLB comprises two leagues, the American League and the National League, encoded as __AL__ and __NL__ in the table. The 5-th and 8-th columns (also 1-indexed) are the league affiliations of the visiting and home team, respectively. Rename these columns __v_league__ and __h_league__."

    "2. Create a plot with two subplots, placed side-by-side. Each subplot should be a scatter plot in which the x- and y-axes correspond to the home and visitor scores, respectively, and in which each point corresponds to a game from the season. In the left-hand plot, include all games in which both teams were in the NL, and in the right-hand plot, include all games in which both teams were in the AL. Games in which the teams were from different leagues should be ignored. Specify the transparency (cf. the __alpha__ parameter in the __matplotlib__ documentation) so that scores that occur more often will be shaded darker than rare scores. Color the points in the scatter plot according to the league affiliation of the two teams as follows: games between two teams both in the AL should be rendered as red points in the scatter plot. Games between two teams both in the NL should be rendered as blue points in the scatter plot. Label your axes and provide an appropriate title for your plot as well as its subplots. Save your plot in a pdf file called __home_vs_away_scores.pdf__. This file does not need to be including in your submission. __Note:__ you may find it useful to create an extra column in the encoding whether a given game is AL vs AL, NL vs NL or mixed."

    "3. The Skellam distribution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellam_distribution) is the distribution that results from taking the difference between two Poisson random variables. It is often suggested as a model for the difference between scores in sports games, particularly baseball. Add a new column to the data frame called __score_diff__, given by the home score minus the away score. Make a histogram of this score difference and give the plot an appropriate title."

    "4. Read the documentation about the __scipy__ implementation of the Skellam distribution at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.skellam.html . If $\\lambda_H$ and $\\lambda_V$ are the means of two independent Poisson random variables $K_H$ and $K_V$, respectively, then the Skellam distribution that describes the difference $K_H - K_V$ has parameters $\\lambda_H$ and $\\lambda_V$. We will assume (perhaps incorrectly) that the correlation and location parameters of the Skellam distribution are both $0$. To fit a Skellam distribution to the data, we will first fit Poisson distributions to the home and away teams. Estimate parameters $\\hat{\\lambda}_H$ and $\\hat{\\lambda}_V$ as the means of the home and visitor scores, respectively. Save your estimates in variables __lambda_home__ and __lambda_visitor__, respectively."

    "5. Now let's run a goodness-of-fit test to see how well the Skellam distribution matches our data. There are several ways to do this, but we will use the $\\chi^2$ test, which is available in __scipy__ as __scipy.stats.chisquare__ (documentation here: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chisquare.html ). There are two problems we must address. First, the Skellam distribution predicts that sometimes $K_H = K_V$, which cannot happen in our data because ties are not allowed in baseball (play continues until a team wins https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_professional_baseball_game), so our model should really be the Skellam distribution conditioned on the fact that $K_H \\neq K_V$. Second, the $\\chi^2$ test as implemented in __scipy__ requires that the observed and expected frequencies be finite-length arrays, but the Skellam distribution gives non-zero probability to every possible integer value. To account for these two issues, we will model the score difference as a Skellam distribution conditioned on the event that $K_H \\neq K_V$ and $|K_H-K_V| \\le 30$ ($36$ is the most runs ever scored by one team in a baseball game, so $30$ is a reasonable upper bound for our purposes). Use the __scipy__ implementation of the $\\chi^2$ test to assess the fit of our model to the data (use the default delta degrees of freedom, __ddof=0__). Save the resulting p-value and the test statistic in variables named __chi2pvalue__ and __chi2stat__, respectively. Does our model agree with the data? What changes might we consider to improve the fit of our model (a few sentences will suffice here--- no need to implement any of these improvements unless you really want to)?"

    "Answer: \n",
    "From the last block in this problem we could see that the \"chi2stat\" is 1395521 and the \"chi2pvalue\" is 0. Both these numbers indicate that the data does not agree with our Skellman model. From two plots at bottom, we could found that the distribution for observed data has wider spread than our Skellman model's data, so one way to improve the fit of our model is to make our model has wider spread shape rather than putting too much emphasis in the center.
